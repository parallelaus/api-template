## Tech Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Framework:** Express.js
- **Package Manager:** Yarn (v4.9.1)
- **Testing:** Jest, Supertest
- **Linting/Formatting:** ESLint, Prettier
- **Schema Validation:** Zod
- **AI/LLM:** Langchain (@langchain/core, @langchain/langgraph, @langchain/openai)
- **Other Key Libraries:**
  - `cors`: For enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
  - `helmet`: For securing Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.
  - `lodash`: Utility library.
  - `uuid`: For generating UUIDs.
  - `dotenv`: For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
  - `rimraf`: For deep deleting directories.
  - `nodemon`: For auto-restarting the application during development.
  - `env-cmd`: For managing environment variables for different environments.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (Version 4.x, as specified in `packageManager`)

## Getting Started

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd dashie.io-api
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables for configuration. You will need to create environment files for different setups:

-   `.env.dev`: For development environment.
-   `.env.test`: For testing environment.
-   A general `.env` file might be used for production builds (loaded by `node -r dotenv/config dist`).

Copy the existing `.env.dev` or create new ones based on your needs. Ensure all required variables (e.g., API keys, database URLs, port numbers) are set.

**Example `.env.dev` structure (based on common practices, customize as needed):**

```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000

# Example API Key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Other service URLs or secrets
# DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
```

## Available Scripts

The `package.json` file defines several scripts for common tasks:

### Building the Project

To compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript (output to the `dist` directory):

```bash
yarn build
```

To build and watch for changes (useful during development if not using `start:dev` with `nodemon` on TS files directly):

```bash
yarn build:dev
```

### Running the Application

To start the compiled application (ensure you've run `yarn build` first):

```bash
yarn start
```
This script uses `dotenv/config` to load variables from a `.env` file if present.

### Running in Development Mode

To start the application in development mode with `nodemon` for automatic restarts on file changes (uses `.env.dev` for environment variables):

```bash
yarn start:dev
```
This script typically watches the `dist` directory, so you might need to run `yarn build:dev` in a separate terminal or ensure your `nodemon` setup handles TypeScript compilation.

### Running Tests

To execute the test suite using Jest (uses `.env.test` for environment variables):

```bash
yarn test
```

### Cleaning the Project

To remove the `dist` (build artifacts) and `coverage` (test coverage reports) directories:

```bash
yarn clean
```

## API Endpoints

<!-- 
Document your API endpoints here. For each endpoint, specify:
- HTTP Method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- URL Path
- Brief description
- Required/Optional parameters (path, query, body)
- Example request
- Example success response
- Example error responses

Example:

### `GET /api/users`
Retrieves a list of all users.

- **Parameters:** None
- **Success Response (200 OK):**
  ```json
  [
    { "id": 1, "username": "user1" },
    { "id": 2, "username": "user2" }
  ]
  ```
